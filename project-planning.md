# Your Task
Create a project plan similar to the CatApp example in the [full stack web architecture notes](./full-stack-web-app-architecture.md).

You'll need to decide:
1. Five things that your website will do (functionalities)
2. Which entities your website will need to store
3. The flow between front end/back end/database for each functionality/user story

You'll then present this plan to the trainer and cohort. You can present it in whatever form works best for you (powerpoint, diagrams, etc.)

The main goal of this is for you to understand the different components of a full-stack web applications and how they interact with each other when you're actually using a website.
